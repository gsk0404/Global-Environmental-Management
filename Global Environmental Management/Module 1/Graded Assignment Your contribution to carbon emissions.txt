TITLE : Your contribution to the climate change,


Depending on, for example, our geographical, social, economic and job-related situation, and not least the choices we make, we contribute differently to carbon emissions. Listen to Kåre Press-Kristensen's description of his and his family's choices. Describe the most important choices you make yourself that influence your contribution and tell why you make these particular choices.

My Contribution to Climate Change

Like everyone else, I contribute to climate change through my daily activities, but I also try to make conscious choices to reduce my carbon footprint. These decisions are shaped by my location, lifestyle, and values.

One of the most important choices I make is using public transportation instead of owning a personal car. I live in an area with good bus and metro connections, which makes this possible. By doing this, I significantly reduce emissions from fuel consumption. It also saves me money, which is important as a student. When I travel longer distances, I try to choose trains over planes whenever possible.

Another major choice is how I eat. I’ve reduced my consumption of meat, especially beef, and try to eat more plant-based meals. This is because livestock farming contributes heavily to methane emissions and deforestation. Eating locally grown vegetables and fruits also reduces the environmental impact caused by transportation and packaging.

At home, I try to save energy. I switch off lights and electronics when not in use, use LED bulbs, and limit heating by wearing warm clothes indoors during winter. These small changes, when consistent, make a difference over time.

Finally, I try to buy less and reuse more. Instead of frequently buying new clothes or electronics, I try to repair and extend the life of what I already have. Fast fashion and tech waste are major contributors to environmental damage.

I make these choices because I believe that individual actions matter. Even though one person can’t solve the climate crisis alone, our collective efforts can lead to change. I also feel a responsibility toward future generations and want to be part of the solution rather than the problem.
