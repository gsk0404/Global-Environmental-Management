TITLE : Environmental Technology: Solar Power in New Delhi, India



Choose a particular geographical location, e.g. a region, country, city - it could be you own living area. Choose one environmental technology that is particularly relevant for your location - or alternatively, one that is currently in use, that you find should be abandoned there. 1) Explain what it is (or should be) used for and how. 2) Elaborate on why this is particularly good or bad for your chosen area. 3) Mention with a short explanation another location in world where your conclusion would be opposite, where that technology would either be good or bad, opposite to your first chosen location.

The answer shall be between 200-400 words and written directly in the textbox below.

 

1) Explanation of Technology: Solar power is a renewable energy technology that harnesses the sun’s energy through photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal systems. These panels convert sunlight directly into electricity, which can be used for household, industrial, or commercial purposes. In New Delhi, solar power can be used to address the city’s increasing energy demands, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and combat air pollution, which is a significant problem in the region.

2) Why it’s Particularly Good or Bad for New Delhi: Solar power is particularly beneficial for New Delhi due to the city’s abundant sunlight. The region enjoys an average of 300 sunny days per year, making it an ideal location for solar energy generation. Implementing solar power technology could reduce the city’s reliance on coal-based electricity, helping to lower carbon emissions and mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution. Additionally, solar power can be decentralized, allowing individual homes, businesses, and communities to generate their own energy, thus reducing the strain on the overburdened power grid. In an area like New Delhi, where the cost of electricity is rising and power outages are common, solar power could provide a reliable and cost-effective alternative.

However, there are challenges such as high initial installation costs, lack of infrastructure for maintenance, and issues related to land availability for large-scale solar farms. Despite these challenges, the environmental benefits far outweigh the downsides, especially given the city’s air pollution levels.

3) Opposite Location – Norway: In contrast, solar power may not be as beneficial in Norway, particularly in the northern regions where sunlight is scarce during the winter months. Norway has long hours of darkness in the winter and limited sunlight during the day. Given this, solar power would not be as efficient or reliable in meeting energy needs. Norway’s energy mix is already heavily reliant on hydroelectric power, which is abundant and renewable, making solar power less critical. In such a location, wind power or hydropower would be more effective solutions for sustainable energy generation. Thus, while solar power is ideal for New Delhi, it is not as suitable for Norway due to the geographical and climatic differences.
